            Weâ€™re a collective of devs, creatives, and grantees helping to build
            the Solana Ecosystem in Germany. We are organised as a co-operative
            of contributors who are experienced in launching and growing
            technology businesses.
          </p>

          <p>
            We value the sovereignty that comes with founding a company, the
            skin in the game that comes with investing, and the joy that comes
            with getting work done.
